This project trains a machine learning model to identify fraudulent online transactions using structured transaction data.

## Structure

- `data/`: Contains the CSV dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
- `models/`: Placeholder for trained models.
- `outputs/`: Generated plots and evaluation metrics.
- `docs/`: Includes Data Management Plan (DMP).

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `sklearn`).
2. Open the notebook in `notebooks/` to run the training and evaluation pipeline.
